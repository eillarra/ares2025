description: General coding standards for the ARES 2025 project.
---

- There is a `.copilot` folder in the root of the repository. You can create summaries for future reference there.
- Feel free to challenge user's requests if they don't make sense or if they go against coding standards.
- Avoid inline comments. Code should be self-explanatory.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- We use `vue` and `quasar` for this PWA, so follow Vue's coding standards.
